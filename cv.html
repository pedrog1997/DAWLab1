                <p>
                    Developed a web application to automatize the admission process for new students at Green Fox
Academy. My role as a developer apart from completing the user stories was to create, organize and
merge all individual branches to the development branch. For each user story completed we had to
create the corresponding test. Frontend done with JavaScript, haml, scss, backend done with Ruby on
Rails, and to manage the databases we used MySQL. We followed SCRUM Methodology with a team of
7 developers, 1 SCRUM master, 1 Product Owner. We completed succesfully 4 sprints.

                <h3>VISION SYSTEM AND ROUTING CALCULATION</h3>
                <p>
                    The Project consisted in a visión system that was trained with four different objects separated into
two categories, long objects and short objects. First an image of a parking lot was analyzed and filtered
to obtain the free spaces where new cars would park. The system would obtain the route the car has
to follow depending on which objects you show to the camera, depending on the combination of one
long object and a short object and its direction, the system would choose one of the four different
entry points.
